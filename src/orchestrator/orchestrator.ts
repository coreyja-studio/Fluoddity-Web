/**
 * Orchestrator: the sole broker of commands and data between modules.
 * The port of `orchestrator/orchestrator.py` and its six command mixins.
 *
 * Owns one instance each of Surface, Camera, Assembler and ParticleSystem, plus
 * the project, history and preferences. Modules hold no references to one
 * another; all inter-module communication flows through here. Two examples of
 * the pattern, both preserved verbatim from the desktop:
 *
 *   - Data: each frame the Orchestrator pulls the current canvas texture from
 *     ParticleSystem (via a narrow accessor) and hands it to Camera. Camera
 *     never holds a persistent reference to it.
 *   - Commands: the UI reports named intents which the Orchestrator translates
 *     into method calls on the right module.
 *
 * **THIS FILE HOLDS THE LOOP, THE WIRING AND THE STATE -- NOT THE HANDLERS.**
 * "Sole broker" means it routes, not that it implements.
 *
 * ## The mixins become composition, and what that changed
 *
 * The desktop has six command mixins (`ProjectCommands`, `ClipboardCommands`,
 * `SettingsCommands`, `SelectionCommands`, `DrawingCommands`, `ShoveCommands`)
 * flattened into one class by Python's MRO, and **the MRO is load-bearing**
 * (`orchestrator.py:106-107`): the mixins own no state, they read and replace
 * attributes defined on the Orchestrator, and they call each other's methods
 * freely. TypeScript has no multiple inheritance, and the plan asks for the
 * cross-calls to become explicit dependencies.
 *
 * So each group is now a MODULE OF FUNCTIONS taking the collaborators it needs
 * (`projectCommands.ts`, `clipboardCommands.ts`, `settingsCommands.ts`), and
 * this class is what holds the state they read and replace. The seams the
 * desktop's section comments marked are the same seams; only the mechanism
 * differs.
 *
 * **What that mechanically prevents:** on the desktop, `ShoveCommands` reaching
 * `self.prefs` is invisible in its signature, so nothing stops a mixin growing
 * a dependency on state it has no business seeing. Here every dependency is an
 * argument, and adding one is visible in the diff.
 *
 * ## Frame order
 *
 * Input is polled at the TOP of the frame, so the physics and rendering that
 * follow act on this frame's input rather than the previous frame's. See
 * `frame()`, which states the two ordering constraints Step 6 established and
 * this step must not break.

   * Only rebuilds when the world size actually moves. Physics rate is live --

   * constructs a fresh `ParticleSystem` whose `_frameCount` starts at zero, and

   * more expensive than the steady state, so a rung measured across them reads
   * as unaffordable when it is not. A physics-only change keeps the same system
   * and its accumulated frame count, so it needs no such burn-in -- which is
   * the difference this return value carries.

   * Run and submit one physics frame, resolving when the GPU has finished it.
   *
   * **WHY NOT JUST TIME `frame()`.** Two reasons, either one fatal.
   *
   * The first is the pause. Calibration runs behind the welcome splash, and the
   * splash pauses the simulation -- a paused `frame()` takes the branch that
   * skips `runFrame` entirely and renders one still image. Timing that would
   * measure the camera, not the physics, and would report the same number for
   * every rung on the ladder.
   *
   * The second is that `performance.now()` around `frame()` measures nothing
   * useful even unpaused. WebGPU submission is asynchronous: `submit` queues a
   * command buffer and returns, so the wall time around it is CPU-side encoding
   * cost, which barely moves as the GPU load changes. That is fine for the
   * debug overlay's readout, which is all it was ever for, and useless as a
   * calibration signal. `onSubmittedWorkDone` is what actually waits for the
   * GPU.
   *
   * SO THIS IS A DELIBERATELY MINIMAL FRAME: physics only, no camera, no
   * assembler, no pick. That narrows what is being measured to the thing the
   * two knobs actually scale, and it is why `HEADROOM` exists to account for
   * everything left out.

   * re-derive on the next load, nor with the flag set and the settings not.
   *
   * **THE RESET IS WHAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES.** Probing advances the
   * simulation -- five frames per rung, at up to 20 sub-steps each, across
   * however many rungs the machine reached. Without this, the first picture
   * someone gets is a few hundred sub-steps of evolution that happened behind a

   * canvas that was reallocated underneath it. A reset makes the run they watch
   * start where a run is supposed to start.

   * on an object about to be destroyed. `rebuildSystem` is async, so this is
   * ordered explicitly rather than by luck -- see below.
