/**
 * Entry point.
 *
 * The desktop analogue is `main.py` (4 lines) plus `Orchestrator.run()`
 * (`orchestrator.py:256-365`). **Step 7 moved the frame loop out of here** and
 * into `orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`, which is where it belongs: this file now
 * acquires a device, builds the Orchestrator and the panel, and turns
 * `requestAnimationFrame` into calls on them.
 *
 * What that leaves here is the three things that are genuinely the entry
 * point's: device acquisition and the unavailable/lost paths, the `?debug`
 * readout, and the startup URL overrides.
 *
 * ## What is still missing, and which step owns it
 *
 * Nothing is missing now: Step 10 finished, and `ui/panel.ts` is the real
 * interface. Step 7's flat registry dump (`ui/thinPanel.ts`) was deleted with
 * the `?ui=thin` escape hatch that kept it reachable through Step 10's
 * sub-steps.

  //
  // A BAD LINK MUST NOT TAKE THE APP DOWN. `start()`'s catch renders the
  // unavailable banner, which is the right response to a missing GPU and
  // entirely the wrong one to a link that got truncated in a chat client -- the
  // app is fine, only the link is not. So this fails soft: warn, remember why,
  // and open the default preset. The user is told once the panel exists to tell
  // them with.

  // tidy things up and would break refresh: F5 or a restored tab would lose the
  // shared project with no way back, and for a link someone was sent that is
  // real data loss -- they may have no other copy. The cost of keeping it is
  // that the URL describes the state the tab ARRIVED in rather than its live
  // state, which is what a fragment normally means anyway, and `Shift+C`
  // regenerates a correct one on demand.
  //
  // NO `hashchange` LISTENER either. Reacting to one would replace the live
  // project and discard unsaved edits in response to a gesture the user does not
  // think of as "open a file". Nothing in the app writes the hash and there are
  // no in-page anchors, so the only way to fire one is to paste a second link

  // integrated one. `calibration/calibrate.ts` walks a fixed progression of
  // settings and keeps the heaviest that stays inside a 60 fps budget.
  //
  // GOES THROUGH `Panel.calibrate()` rather than calling `calibrate` directly,
  // so this shares one path with the OTHER trigger -- Reset Editor Preferences,
  // which puts someone back on defaults their machine was never measured
  // against. That path holds the splash up and locked for the duration; doing
  // it here too is what makes the two behave identically.
  //
  // **DELIBERATELY NOT AWAITED.** The rAF loop below has to start immediately:
  // calibration runs behind the welcome splash so the wait costs the user
  // nothing, and that only works if the splash is up and the simulation is
  // visible while the probes run. Awaiting here would blank the screen for the
  // whole walk, which is precisely the first impression this exists to avoid.
  //
  // The two loops overlap safely. Both submit work to the same queue, which
  // serializes them; rung transitions go through `rebuildSystem`, which builds
  // the replacement before dropping the old one, so the rAF loop always reads a
  // valid system. It may render one frame at a rung the ladder has already
  // moved past, which is invisible.
  //
