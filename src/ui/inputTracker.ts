/**
 * InputTracker: raw events in, one frozen `InputState` per frame out.
 *
 * The port of `ui.py`'s accumulator half -- the state at `ui.py:82-97`, the
 * five GLFW callbacks at `:141-190`, and the freeze/drain at `:196-255`.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate file from the DOM listeners
 *
 * Everything that DECIDES anything lives here, and this file imports nothing
 * from `window`. `npm test` runs under `node --test` with no DOM, so a tracker
 * that touched `document` could not be tested at all -- and the three
 * asymmetries below are exactly the kind of thing that is silent when wrong and
 * miserable to debug in a browser. `inputBinding.ts` is the other half: it adds
 * listeners and translates their events into calls on this class, and holds no
 * state of its own.
 *
 * ## Capture is resolved by the CALLER, once, per event
 *
 * The `capturedByUi` parameters are the port of imgui's `want_capture_mouse` /
 * `want_capture_keyboard`. On the desktop those are free: `ui.py:66-80` installs
 * its handlers after imgui's and forwards to them, so each callback can ask
 * imgui what it just claimed. The DOM hit-tests before the handler runs, so
 * `inputBinding.ts` reconstructs the same answer from the event target.
 *
 * Either way the rule is the desktop's: by the time anything reads the frozen
 * state, the plain fields already mean "meant for the canvas", and **no
 * consumer downstream checks a capture flag**.
 *
 * ## The three asymmetries, which are the reason this class exists
 *
 * Documented at `inputState.ts:26-40` as properties of what the fields MEAN;
 * this is where they are implemented, each at its site:
 *
 *   1. A CAPTURED PRESS IS DROPPED ENTIRELY -- it sets neither `held` nor
 *      `dragging`, so a press that lands on the panel can never start a canvas
 *      drag (`ui.py:174-181`).
 *   2. A RELEASE IS NEVER CAPTURE-FILTERED -- it always clears `held` and
 *      `dragging`, whatever it landed on. This is what guarantees a drag
 *      terminates (`ui.py:182-185`).
 *   3. HELD STATE PERSISTS ACROSS FRAMES; one-shots drain. `freeze()` clears
 *      the events and leaves the conditions (`ui.py:244-252`).

 * behaviour -- would dispatch a pick at the start of every pinch, before the
 * second finger has landed. Touch therefore decides tap-vs-drag by this slop:
 * inside it a release is a tap, beyond it the finger is a drag (the left
 * button, held).

  // which on the Draw tool means a smear across the field you just framed.

  // fling the view. `rebaseTouch()` at every down/up is what makes those
