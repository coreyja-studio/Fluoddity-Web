/**
 * The DOM listeners: events in, `InputTracker` calls out.
 *
 * The port of `ui.py:141-190` -- the five GLFW callbacks. This file is
 * deliberately the ONLY one in the input path that touches `window` or
 * `document`, and it holds no state, so that everything with a decision in it
 * stays testable under `node --test` (see `inputTracker.ts`).
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * CAPTURE, AND WHY THE BROWSER MAKES THIS THE INTERESTING FILE
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * The desktop gets capture arbitration free. `ui.py:66-80` installs its GLFW
 * callbacks AFTER imgui's and keeps imgui's bound methods, so every handler
 * forwards the event to imgui and then reads `want_capture_mouse` -- imgui has
 * already updated it, mid-callback, synchronously.
 *
 * The DOM has no such flag, because it hit-tests BEFORE dispatching: by the
 * time a handler runs, the browser has already decided which element the event
 * belongs to. So capture here is reconstructed from that decision --
 * `event.target` being inside the canvas, or not. Same answer, arrived at from
 * the opposite direction.
 *
 * Three listeners are on `window` rather than the canvas, and each for a
 * reason that is one of the desktop's asymmetries:
 *
 *   - `pointerup` -- a release must be seen wherever it lands, or a drag that
 *     ends over the panel never terminates.
 *   - `pointermove` -- position is never capture-filtered, so a drag keeps
 *     tracking the cursor across the UI.
 *   - `keydown`/`keyup` -- the canvas has no `tabindex` and cannot hold focus,
 *     so keys arrive at `document.body` and there is nothing else to listen on.
