/**
 * The welcome splash: what Fluoddity is, and how to drive it.
 *
 * Shown once at startup, dismissed by a click on the backdrop (or any key) --
 * the card itself is reading material, not a button. It is deliberately the
 * simplest thing in `ui/`: no command bus, no status, no refresh. It has one
 * piece of state (shown / not shown) and one transition, so it takes none of
 * the machinery the panel needs.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a `<dialog showModal()>`
 *
 * `dialogs.ts` uses native modals precisely because it wants focus trapping and
 * an inert backdrop -- a save dialog is a QUESTION, and the app should not
 * proceed until it is answered. This is the opposite: the simulation is running
 * underneath and is meant to be seen running. So it is an ordinary fixed
 * overlay whose backdrop IS the dismiss target, and the canvas keeps rendering
 * behind it.
 *
 * ## It mounts outside the panel container
 *
 * Same reason as the menu bar and the dialogs (`ui.py:274-289`): `X` toggles
 * the panel's `display`, and the splash is not the panel's business. It is
 * gone by the time anyone reaches for `X` anyway.
 *
 * ## The instance outlives any one showing
 *
 * `dismiss()` detaches the node and unbinds the key listener, but keeps both --
 * Help > Welcome / Controls re-shows the same instance. Building the DOM once
 * and reattaching it is what makes `show()` cheap enough to call from a menu,
 * and it keeps the scroll position resettable in one place.
 *
 * The keydown listener is bound only WHILE VISIBLE, so a dismissed splash costs
 * nothing per keystroke and can never swallow a key meant for the simulation.
